TakeNote INSTALL
===============


Windows Install

  There is a Binary Installer for Windows available on the TakeNote website.
  It is the recommended way to install TakeNote for Windows.


Linux Install

  Required libraries  
    For example, if you use Debian or something compatible...

    $ apt-get install python python-gtk2 python-glade2 libgtk2.0-dev


  Optional libraries

    Spell checking
    $ apt-get install python-gnome2-extras

  Once third-party libraries are installed, you can run takenote directly 
  from its source directory 

    $ path-to-takenote-src/bin/takenote

  or you can install with python distutils

    $ python setup.py install


MacOS X Install

  All third-party libraries for the Linux version of TakeNote are 
  cross-platform and should also work for MacOS X.  

     - python (http://www.python.org)
     - gtk (http://www.gtk.org)
     - pygtk (http://www.pygtk.org)

  All of these libraries are also available through fink for MaxOS X.  Once
  installed, TakeNote can be run directly from its source directory

    $ path-to-takenote-src/bin/takenote

  
  Alternative: Another option for running TakeNote is to use the Windows 
  version in WINE or another Virtual Machine (VMware, etc).


=============================================================================
Windows Build

  Most people will just want to install TakeNote.  For basic installation, 
  see the Windows Install instructions above.  These  instructions are for 
  developers who want to *build* the windows installer.
  
  First install these third party packages.  Versions that are known
  to work are given below, but higher version are likely to also work.
  
    python-2.5.1.msi
    gtk-dev-2.12.9-win32-2.exe
    pygtk-2.12.1-1.win32-py2.5.exe
    pyobject-2.14.1-1.win32-py2.5.exe
    pycario-1.4.12-1.win32-py2.5.exe
    py2exe-0.6.6.win32-py2.5.exe
    isetup-5.2.3.exe  (Inno Setup)
  
  NOTE: pygtk-2.12.1-2.win32-py2.5.exe (notice the -2) seems to have a bug
  with get_source_widget()

  Once third-party packages are installed, execute in the takenote source dir:
  
  $ python setup.exe py2exe
  - Use Inno to compile installer.iss
  
  Installer will be in Output/takenote-XXX.exe
