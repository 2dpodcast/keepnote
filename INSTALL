Windows Build

  See the Window Install instructions for basic installation.  These 
  instructions are for developers who want to *build* the windows installer.
  
  First install these third party packages.  Versions that are know to work are
  given below, but higher version are likely to also work.
  
    python-2.5.1.msi
    gtk-dev-2.12.9-win32-2.exe
    pygtk-2.12.1-2.win32-py2.5.exe
    pyobject-2.14.1-1.win32-py2.5.exe
    pycario-1.4.12-1.win32-py2.5.exe
    py2exe-0.6.6.win32-py2.5.exe
    isetup-5.2.3.exe
  
  Once third-party packages are installed, execute in the takenote source dir:
  
  $ python setup.exe py2exe
  - Use Inno to compile installer.iss
  
  Installer will be in Output/takenote-XXX.exe
